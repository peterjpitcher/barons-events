# UI Copy Tone Guide

Barons Events aims to feel like a calm operations assistant—confident, human, and free of engineering jargon. Use this guide whenever you write or edit in-product copy.

## Voice & Tone
- Friendly but concise; speak as a trusted teammate, not as support chat.
- Lead with the benefit or action the user can take right now.
- Acknowledge when something is delayed or unavailable, and offer the next best step.

## Language Guidelines
- Prefer everyday words (e.g. “response deadline” instead of “SLA”, “calendar link” instead of “ICS feed”).
- Avoid command-line references, file paths, or environment variable names in UI surfaces.
- When linking to documentation, describe it plainly (e.g. “Executive calendar guide”) rather than showing the filename.
- Keep button text action-oriented and positive (“Send test alert” beats “Ping webhook”).

## Patterns to Encourage
- Summaries that translate data into meaning (“3 venues need rescheduling this week”).
- Error states that explain what happened and how to recover.
- Empty states that set expectations, then guide the user to their next task.

## Terms to Avoid
- “cron”, “seed”, “Supabase”, “CLI”, “build”, “stand-up”, “sprint”.
- Acronyms without context. If one is unavoidable, define it (“response deadline (sometimes called an SLA)”).

## Quick Self-Check
- Would a venue manager understand this without asking an engineer?
- Does every button, badge, or alert point to an action or reassurance?
- Are we reinforcing the Barons brand friendliness by keeping sentences clear and calm?
